# Projects
  
## Cascade Tool
### AppID: 212165
This tool solved a long time problem in AMP which required many hoops to be jumped through in a specific order to make changes to existing AMP user accounts which are connected to many loans. 
This tool is comprised of a few screens. The first screen is one to take in a team member CBID. The second contains a list of the user functions associated with the CBID which need to be verified. 

## Creating Custom Sonar Rules
  *  https://git.rockfin.com/AMP/custom-sonar-rules/pull/83

This is a custom Sonar rule which is implemented by sonarqube to detect and block users from storing email addresses in pop-up tables. A better method of storing emails was created which is object oriented. This was a much needed upgrade which makes it much easeier to find emails that are stored in AMP and even easier to update emails in the future. The third screen allows changes to all available fields so that they can be updated later. Lastly is a screen to ask if the user would like to update now or schedule for later in a tidal job.
The technologies used were: Java, Maven, Progress, html, and GitHub.
